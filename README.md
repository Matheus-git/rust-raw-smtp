![rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)

A lightweight and efficient raw SMTP client built with Rust. This project provides a simple implementation for sending emails via SMTP without relying on third-party libraries. For local testing, MailHog is used as the SMTP server.

**This project was developed in just a few hours as part of a training exercise over the weekend.**

## Architecture

This project follows a layered architecture, applying concepts from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) such as Factory and Repository patterns. Additionally, the Template Method pattern is used to define a generic workflow for sending emails while allowing specific customizations.
